The tropical storm moved steadily north across southeast Louisiana and by the afternoon of September 26 was located in central Mississippi downgraded to a tropical depression. Tropical Storm Isidore had a large circulation with tropical storm force winds extending several hundreds of miles from its center. Prior to moving onto the Yucatan Peninsula earlier in the week and weakening, Isidore was classified as a major hurricane.  Swells from the distant hurricane resulted in rip tides along the northern Gulf of Mexico, with a 41 year old man drowning on the afternoon of Sunday, Sept 22, 2002 at Port Fourchon, Lafouche Parish.   

 The large circulation caused a significant storm surge over a large area for a tropical storm. Tide levels were 4 to 6 feet above normal across much of southeast Louisiana from Grand Isle eastward to the Pearl River. Storm surge flooding occurred outside of the hurricane protection levees across Lafourche, Jefferson, Plaquemine, St. Bernard, and Orleans Parishes, inundating roadways and flooding some non-elevated structures. Across Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas, storm surge of 4 to 5 feet above normal were measured. Low lying areas, roadways and some non-elevated structures in parishes surrounding Lake Pontchartrain and Maurepas were flooded. St. Tammany Parish was particularly hard hit with storm surge flooding when the Isidore moved north of the area, and the winds shifted to a southwest direction causing water levels to rapidly increase along the north shore  of Lake Pontchartrain on the morning of Thursday, September 26, 2000. The storm surge overtopped or breached a small local levee system in southern portions of Slidell causing water to flood several hundred homes.   Approximately 1000 homes were flooded in the parish from either storm surge, river flooding, or from flooding from heavy rain

Rainbands associated with Tropical Storm Isidore produced heavy rainfall in a wide area prior to and shortly after landfall. The greater New Orleans area, was particularly hard hit on the late afternoon and early evening Wednesday, September 25, 2002. Four to eight inches of rainfall occurred within 6 hours time. Drainage systems were overwhelmed by the heavy rain and numerous streets were flooded, automobiles were flooded, and water entered some homes. Portions of Terrebonne and Lafourche Parishes were also hard hit during the early morning of Thursday, September 26, 2002 with homes flooded when heavy rainfall overwhelmed drainage. Between 200 and 300 homes and businesses were reported flooded in Terrebonne Parish. Storm total rainfall of 10 to 15 inches were common across southeast Louisiana. 

Most areas recorded sustained winds of 35 to 45 mph with some gusts to 50 mph in sqaulls. The highest wind speeds were observed near the coast or tidal lakes.  Grand Isle, on the coast, recorded the highest wind gust of 71 mph.

A tornado touched down near Golden Meadow, Lafourche Parish, where a couple of sheriff's office patrol cars were damaged along with several storage buildings.

The Louisiana Office of Emergency Preparedness reported appoximately 2500 people sought refuge in approximately 40 shelters in the state. 

As of late November 2002, the Louisiana State Insurance Department reported that insurance industry has indicated that Tropical Storm Isidore had  resulted in $105 million in insured losses. Approximately 166,200 claims had been filed with private insurance companies.
A reliable estimate of uninsured losses had not been determined as of the end of November 2002.

The hurricane weakened rapidly to a Saffir Simpson Scale Category 1 Hurricane by the time it made landfall during the morning of October 3rd along the south central Louisiana coast. The hurricane continued to moved north northwest across south central Louisiana before turning northeast across the northern portion of the state.  Due to the rapid weakening, no sustained hurricane force winds were measured in southeast Louisiana.  However, storm surge was significant across the southeast Louisiana coastal areas and tidal lakes. Storm surge tides were 3 to 5 feet above normal across much of coastal southeast Louisiana except 4 to 7 feet above normal across south Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes, closer to the location where the hurricane made landfall. 

Storm surge caused the most damage in Terrebonne Parish where many communities situated along bayous in the southern portion of the parish received considerable flooding. Storm surge also overtopped or breached several locally built drainage levees during the morning hours of October 4th. Particularly hard hit was the community of Montegut where many homes were flooded several feet deep. Over a thousand homes and businesses in Terrebonne Parish sustained some type of water damage due to storm surge. 

Storm surge flooding was also reported in southern Lafourche Parish where areas outside of the Larose-Golden Meadow were inundated by storm surge flooding.  Grand Isle also was hit with considerable storm surge and beach erosion. 

Considerable flooding of roadways and low lying structures was reported in many areas in coastal southeast Louisiana outside of the hurricane protection levees. Along Lake Pontchartrain and Maurepas, low lying roadways and structures were also flooded, many having been flooded a week earlier due to Tropical Storm Isidore. 

No sustained hurricane force winds were measured across southeast Louisiana. Highest wind gusts recorded on October 3rd included: Houma 61 mph at 0200 CST, Paincourtville 61 mph at 0700 CST, New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport  51 mph at 0400 CST, Baton Rouge 47 mph at 1117 CST, and Mid Lake Pontchartrain Causeway 69 mph at 0530 CST.

Strong wind gusts downed trees and large tree branches across much of southeast Louisiana. Property damage occurred when the trees and tree limbs fell onto houses and automobiles.

The hurricane weakened rapidly to a Saffir Simpson Scale Category 1 Hurricane by the time it made landfall during the morning of October 3rd along the south central Louisiana coast. The hurricane continued to moved north northwest across south central Louisiana before turning northeast across the northern portion of the state.  Due to the rapid weakening, no sustained hurricane force winds were measured in southeast Louisiana.  However, storm surge was significant across the southeast Louisiana coastal areas and tidal lakes. Storm surge tides were 3 to 5 feet above normal across much of coastal southeast Louisiana except 4 to 7 feet above normal across south Lafourche and Terrebonne Parishes, closer to the location where the hurricane made landfall. 

Storm surge caused the most damage in Terrebonne Parish where many communities situated along bayous in the southern portion of the parish received considerable flooding. Storm surge also overtopped or breached several locally built drainage levees during the morning hours of October 4th. Particularly hard hit was the community of Montegut where many homes were flooded several feet deep. Over a thousand homes and businesses in Terrebonne Parish sustained some type of water damage due to storm surge. 

Storm surge flooding was also reported in southern Lafourche Parish where areas outside of the Larose-Golden Meadow were inundated by storm surge flooding.  Grand Isle also was hit with considerable storm surge and beach erosion. 

Considerable flooding of roadways and low lying structures was reported in many areas in coastal southeast Louisiana outside of the hurricane protection levees. Along Lake Pontchartrain and Maurepas, low lying roadways and structures were also flooded, many having been flooded a week earlier due to Tropical Storm Isidore. 

No sustained hurricane force winds were measured across southeast Louisiana. Highest wind gusts recorded on October 3rd included: Houma 61 mph at 0200 CST, Paincourtville 61 mph at 0700 CST, New Orleans Louis Armstrong Intl Airport  51 mph at 0400 CST, Baton Rouge 47 mph at 1117 CST, and Mid Lake Pontchartrain Causeway 69 mph at 0530 CST.

Strong wind gusts downed trees and large tree branches across much of southeast Louisiana. Property damage occurred when the trees and tree limbs fell onto houses and automobiles. In St. Tammany Parish, one man was injured when a tree fell on the mobile home in which he was living. In Point Coupee Parish, the emergency manager reported 800 to 1000 trees were blown down.  

Several short lived tornadoes touched down producing only minor property damage. Heavy rainfall was not widespread, in part due to the rapid movement of the hurricane away from the area. Flash flooding occurred in only a couple of areas.",202

Matthew made landfall as minimal tropical storm along the south central Louisiana coast near Cocodrie on October 10 and weakened to a tropical depression shortly after moving inland. Matthew continued north and moved across southeast Louisiana and southwest Mississippi as a tropical depression on the 10th before dissipating over extreme southeast Arkansas on October 11.

Tropical storm force winds associated with Matthew were mainly confined to the coastal areas of Terrebonne, Lafourche, Jefferson, and Plaquemines Parishes and around Lake Pontchartrain in the form of gusts. The highest sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was at the NOAA automated weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 42 knots (48 mph) with gusts to 48 knots (55 mph). The weather instruments at this location are located approximately 100 ft above sea level. The lowest pressure recorded was 999.7 mb at Tambour Bay on October 10th 0400 CST.

Most of the damage associated from Matthew was the result of a combination of heavy rain and coastal flooding. Rainfall amounts generally ranged from 5 to 10 inches with a few locations in Terrebonne, Lafourche and St. John the Baptist Parishes reporting amounts up to 13 to 16 inches. The storm surge was 2 to 4 feet above normal, but locally higher in some locations. The highest storm surge recorded was at Frenier on Lake Pontchartrain with a reading of 5.85 ft NGVD.  The greatest damage occurred in Terrebonne Parish where at estimated 20 homes sustained damage from heavy rain and storm surge in an area from Chauvin to Dulac, Montegut, and Pointe Aux Chene. In Lafourche several homes were flooded outside the flood gates from storm surge while within the flood gates several homes in Golden Meadow, Galliano, and Cutoff were flooded due to heavy rain. Law enforcement reported a brief tornado touchdown near Golden Meadow at 0349 CST on October 10th that tore half of the roof off of a trailer. Coastal flooding was observed around the shores of Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas and in most coastal areas outside of hurricane protection levees. Many roads were closed due to storm tide flooding in Lower Terrebonne, Lafourche, St. Bernard, and extreme eastern Orleans Parishes.  Several roads in Slidell and Mandeville in St. Tammany Parish and around Laplace in St. John the Baptist Parish were also flooded.

Based on observed damage, damages described by media and emergency management, and using a comparison of similar tropical storm events, total storm damage was estimated around 255 thousand dollars with approximately $50 thousand in damage from wind, $100 thousand in damage from storm surge, $100 thousand in damage from flooding as a result of heavy rain, and $5 thousand in damage from a brief tornado touchdown.",364

Matthew made landfall as minimal tropical storm along the south central Louisiana coast near Cocodrie on October 10 and weakened to a tropical depression shortly after moving inland. Matthew continued north and moved across southeast Louisiana and southwest Mississippi as a tropical depression on the 10th before dissipating over extreme southeast Arkansas on October 11.

Tropical storm force winds associated with Matthew were mainly confined to the coastal areas of Terrebonne, Lafourche, Jefferson, and Plaquemines Parishes and around Lake Pontchartrain in the form of gusts. The highest sustained wind recorded in southeast Louisiana was at the NOAA automated weather station at the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River with sustained winds of 42 knots (48 mph) with gusts to 48 knots (55 mph).
