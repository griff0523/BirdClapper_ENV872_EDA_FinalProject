Ample Pacific moisture streamed northeast across Northern Mexico and across Texas and Louisiana, ahead of a large upper level trough that slowly dug through the Desert Southwest and Northern Mexico into Southern New Mexico and West Texas. Large scale forcing increased near this low level boundary such that areas of heavy rain developed and moved repeatedly over the same areas along and just south of the Interstate 20 corridor. ||Given the already wet soil moisture conditions in place from much above normal rainfall that had fallen since early September, much of this rainfall ran off, and contributed to extensive areas of flash flooding across East Texas and North Louisiana.

Between twenty and thirty homes were in danger of flooding. ||Shortly before 7 am on November 13th, a Chevy Tahoe carrying seven occupants including six children ages 8-16, drove through the floodwaters on the closed section of Linwood Avenue and Barron Road in Southern Caddo Parish.

Several homes in the Bentley area were flooded. Portions of Springhill Road, Racetrack Road, and Highway 167 near Gray's Creek Road were flooded and closed.","A large upper level ridge of high pressure centered over New Mexico during the daytime hours of July 30th, extended north and east across the Plains into the Mississippi Valley, resulting in a deep northerly flow into the Lower Mississippi Valley. An upper level shortwave trough rounding the center of the upper ridge axis shifted south across the Lower Mississippi Valley during the morning through the mid-afternoon hours, which when combined with daytime heating and a very warm, moist, and unstable air mass in place, resulted in increased large scale forcing that allowed for areas of showers and thunderstorms to develop over the southern sections of Northcentral Louisiana. These storms continued to develop and move repeatedly over the same areas of Eastern and Southern Grant Parish into much of Rapides Parish/adjacent Central Louisiana parishes, with widespread rainfall amounts of 5-8 inches falling, with localized heavier amounts in excess of 11 inches measured in the Ball community in extreme Northern Rapides Parish. This resulted in areas of flash flooding across Southern Grant Parish in the Bentley community, where several roads were flooded and closed and water had entered several homes.",202
