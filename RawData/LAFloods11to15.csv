The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening. The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 21 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 21, 11 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant. The other violent tornado to impact the Jackson, MS forecast area occurred across Smith, Jasper, and Clarke Counties. This tornado continued into Alabama and had a total path length of 124 miles across both states.||Loss of life during this historic event was staggering. 321 people lost their lives making this the second deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history. The March 18, 1925 Tri-State tornado outbreak is first with 747 fatalities. This marks the first EF-5 tornado in Mississippi since the Candlestick Park tornado on May 3, 1966, and this marks the first time since statistics have been kept that two EF-5 tornadoes have been recorded on the same day in Mississippi, with the tornado in Smithville also rated as EF-5. Incredibly, 4 tornadoes had path lengths over 100 miles across the southern states during this event, and all 4 of these were rated either EF-4 or EF-5.",33

The magnitude of flooding was comparable to the floods of 1927, 1983, and 1993.  Moderate to major flood levels were reached during May along the Mississippi River from Red River Landing to Donaldsonville, with moderate to minor flood stages reached from Donaldsonville south to the metro New Orleans area.  High river flows and stages prompted the Corps of Engineers to operate both the Morganza Spillway, north of Baton Rouge, and the Bonnet Carre Spillway, west of New Orleans.  The maximum opening of the Bonnet Carre Spillway was reached in mid to late May when 330 of the 360 total gates were opened .  The Morganza Spillway was utilized for the first time since 1973.  A maximum of 17 of the 125 potential gates were opened  by May 18, with gate closures beginning in the latter part of May.  The combination of  spillway openings and river levees protected the populated areas of southeast Louisiana from floodwaters.  River transportation and industries along the river did suffer some economic effect from high water.  Low land flooding occurred along the Morganza Floodway when the Morganza Spillway was opened.

Isaac strengthened into a hurricane on the morning of the 28th when it was 75 miles south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River.  Isaac made landfall in Plaquemines Parish as a Category 1 Hurricane near Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River on the evening of the 28th. A second landfall occurred near Port Fourchon the following morning. The storm weakened to a tropical storm on the afternoon of the 29th about 50 miles west southwest of New Orleans, and weakened further to a tropical depression on the afternoon of the 30th near Monroe, Louisiana. || The highest wind gust recorded on land in Louisiana was 75 knots, or 86 mph, measured by a portable weather station (Texas Tech University) near Buras on the evening at August 28.  The maximum sustained wind in Louisiana was 65 knots, or 75 mph, at the same portable weather station near Buras on the evening of August 28.  There were several marine observations near the coast that had slightly higher wind readings, but their observation heights were generally 80 ft or higher. ||Due to Isaac���s  very large size, and slow forward speed, tropical storm force winds lasted in excess of 48 hours in many areas of coastal southeast Louisiana. Occasional hurricane gusts of 70 to 85 mph were recorded across southeast Louisiana during the night of the Aug 28th and early on the 29th, especially south of Lake Pontchartrain. Interior areas of southeast Louisiana such as around Baton Rouge and northward experienced tropical storm force winds. Widespread power outages occurred across the area. Local utility companies reported over 700,000 customers were without power at the peak of the storm in southeast Louisiana.  Generally, most of the wind damage was limited to downed trees and power lines, and roof damage caused by wind and falling trees and tree limbs.||The minimum sea level pressure measured from a land station was 965 mb on the morning of Aug 29 at a portable weather station ( Texas Tech Univ) located near Larose.   A pressure of 974.3 mb was measured at a NOAA gage at Bayou Gauche on the morning of August 29th.  Close to the landfall location, a reading 969.8 mb was measured at the NOAA NOS station at Pilots Station near Southwest Pass  on the evening of the  29th shortly after the first landfall. The height of this measurement was 24 meter or 79 feet. ||A storm tide of 8 to 13 feet  occurred in eastern Plaquemines Parish and St. Bernard Parish.  A representative maximum storm tide of 13.21 ft NAVD88 was measured at a USGS tide gage near Pointe a la Hache. A local levee was overtopped or breached in the Braithwaite area of Plaquemines Parish early on August 29. A number of people had to be rescued from the flooded area, but a 60 year old woman and 52 year old man drowned in the storm surge. ||Significant impact also occurred around Lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas with a storm tide of 5 to 9  feet. 5 to 10 thousand homes were flooded in low lying areas of that border these lakes of the following parishes: St. Tammany, Tangipahoa, Livingston, Ascension, St James and St John the Baptist.   Laplace in St. John the Baptist was especially hard hit with over 5,000 homes flooded by storm surge.  An additional storm surge fatality occurred in St. Tammany Parish on the morning of the 30th when a 75 year old man drove his car into a storm surge filled ditch. ||Storm surge flooding also affected areas south and southwest of New Orleans with a storm tide of 4 to 7 feet. Roadways and low lying property were flooded. Local levees around Lafitte and Myrtle Grove were overtopped and/or breached resulting flooding of numerous houses and property in this area.||Many areas of southeast Louisiana received 8 to 12 inches of rain with a few locations having 15 inches of rain or more.  Maximum storm total rainfall was 20.66 inches at the New Orleans Carrollton gauge on the Mississippi River.  Rainfall run-off produced moderate to major flooding on the Tangipahoa, Tchefuncte, Tickfaw, Amite, Pearl, Bogue Chitto and Bogue Falaya Rivers.  Storm surge and high tides restricted outflow of the rivers near the coast and lakes exacerbating flooding in those areas.   ||Overall  impacts of Isaac resulted in at least $600 million in damages in southeast Louisiana, 3 direct fatalities, and 2 indirect fatalities.  Storm surge flooding accounted for the bulk of damage, estimated around $500 million and the three direct storm surge fatalities in Louisiana. Winds accounted for a much lesser amount of slightly more than a $100 million. As stated earlier, these are early damage estimates and will likely be adjusted upward due to later damage assessments.||During the recovery process there were two indirect fatalities. On Sept 1, A 67 year man was electrocuted when attempting to restore power to his house in Abita Springs, St Tammany Parish. On Sept 3, a 90 year old man died of heat related impacts in his house in Marrero, Jefferson Parish, where power had not been restored.",167

The Red River in Shreveport fell below the 33 foot major flood stage on June 15th and fell below the 30 foot flood stage on June 17th.

Approximately 150 dwellings were affected with 40 homes completely inundated.  The worst subdivisions affected were the Allendale and Martin Luther King Jr. subdivisions. 38 homes were damaged in the Martin Luther King subdivision, 41 homes in the Allendale subdivision and 6 additional homes in Southeast Shreveport and an unknown number of homes off of Wells Island Road.  Other subdivisions that were threatened included The Haven and Les Maison subdivisions off of East Kings Highway.  These subdivisions which were built inside the Red River levee system were saved due to hundreds of residents sandbagging their homes. The Downtown Shreveport River Front suffered severe river flooding with two feet of water covering the Clyde Fant Parkway and the Barnwell Center portion of Downtown Shreveport.  Sandbagging efforts resulted in no businesses suffering any water damage from the swollen river. The Northwest Louisiana Red Cross opened 2 shelters to house those residents whose homes were threatened or inundated.  The City of Shreveport worked with its partners to protect key city infrastructure including the Amiss Water Plant and the Lucas and North Regional Waste Water Treatment Plants. 255,000 sand bags were made available by local law enforcement and the Louisiana Governor's Office of Homeland Security with 655,000 more sandbags on standby.  The Governor of Louisiana authorized the activation of up to 200 Louisiana National Guardsman on State Active Duty to support flood response efforts in Northwest Louisiana and assist local, parish and state emergency officials. The Louisiana National Guard Engineering Team constructed an 800 linear foot HESCO barrier, consisting of two rows on the bottom and one on the top totalling 2400 linear feet, to fortify a concrete wall located at Clyde Fant Parkway and Jimmy Davis Highway in Shreveport.  Prior to this, the Guardsmen constructed a 610 linear foot temporary berm while assisting Caddo Parish officials to improve protection measures of the Stoner Lift Station.  Caddo, Bossier, Red River, Natchitoches and Grant Parishes signed emergency declarations due to the excessive flooding and disaster teams from The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and The Governor's Office of Homeland & Emergency Preparedness (GOHSEP) surveying efforts continued as of this writing.
