Some of the more impressive 5 day totals across the parish were as follows: Shreveport Southern Hills: 14.88, Shreveport 3.4 ENE: 14.70, Keithville: 13.60, Mooringsport 1N: 11.56.  The Louisiana National Guard was deployed by the Governor of Louisiana to assist local law enforcement in the massive response to the prolonged flooding event.  These operations included evacuations, search and rescue, distribution and supply of water and meals, security and shelter support and distribution of sandbags and sandbag filling machines. In addition, 36 high water vehicles and 16 boats were called in to assist in the effort.  Over 50 roads were closed during the height of the storm across Caddo Parish. Numerous high water rescues were conducted by first responders which included rescuing occupants trapped in their vehicles as well as the rescuing of residents from flooded homes across the parish.  Flooding was significant for residents along Caddo Lake, Cross Lake and Wallace Lake across Caddo Parish as well as all these reservoirs saw significant rises from the excessive heavy rainfall.  Caddo Lake in Mooringsport, Louisiana crested at 179.95 feet on the morning of March 15th which was 8 feet above flood stage and was the highest stage recorded on Caddo Lake since the flood of May 3rd, 1966.  At this stage, major flooding occurred of most homes and businesses, especially ones that were unstilted.  Numerous roadways were flooded and closed that lead into Caddo Lake and nearly all travel is restricted to boat travel only.  Cross Lake in Shreveport was another lake severely impacted by the excessive heavy rainfall.  The lake rose and crested to 177.02 feet on March 10th which was 4 feet above flood stage.  This was a record stage for Cross Lake in Shreveport, surpassing the previous record stage of 176.70 feet on April 15th, 1991.  Numerous homes were flooded and/or cutoff along the shores of the lake along with numerous roads around the lake including South Lakeshore and North Lakeshore Drives.  On Wallace Lake across the extreme southern border of Caddo Parish, the lake rose to 160.23 feet on March 11th which is 9.2 feet above flood stage.  This was a record stage for Wallace Lake, surpassing the previous record of 159.65 feet set back on Jan 31st, 1999.  At this stage, some 70 homes were flooded below the Wallace Lake Dam along with secondary roads towards and away from the lake were flooded as well.  Flooding also closed all four north and south bound lanes of Interstate 49. The Governor's Office of Homeland Security determined that upwards of 350 homes across Caddo Parish were completely flooded with 1121 homes having registered some sort of flood damage from the 5-day event.  Public property damage estimates were still pending at the time of this writing.  Several Red Cross shelters were set up across the parish for flooded residents.  As a result, the Governor of Louisiana declared a State of Emergency for Caddo Parish and wrote a Federal Disaster Declaration for the parish as well.","A strong upper level low pressure system settled over northern Mexico on March 8th, and became stationary through March 12th as it was cut off from the upper level jet stream, with a blocking upper ridge having developed over Florida and the western Atlantic. Meanwhile, a weak frontal boundary entered the region from the west on the 8th, and became stationary over Deep East Texas, Northwest Louisiana, and Southwest Arkansas. Upper level disturbances ejected northeast ahead of the Northern Mexico low pressure system, resulting in periods of showers and thunderstorms containing heavy rainfall to move repeatedly over these areas. The air mass was most unstable on the 8th, where several severe thunderstorms developed and produced wind damage across portions of Northwest and North Central Louisiana, as well as East Texas. However, widespread heavy rainfall was relentless along and ahead of the surface front over Deep East Texas, all of North Louisiana, and Southwest Arkansas where widespread flash flooding occurred. Widespread rainfall amounts of 12-18 inches fell during the 4 day period across Deep East Texas and all of North Louisiana, with amounts in excess of 24 inches across Ouachita Parish. This flooding was of epic proportions across the entire northern half of the state, something the Emergency Management community said they have never experienced before.  Thousands of structures suffered some sort of water damage along with thousands of road surfaces as well.  Many road surfaces, bridges and low water crossings were completely washed out.  This resulted in many high water rescues of stranded motorists, especially during the very beginnings of the prolonged flooding event.  Many motorists drove around barricades and into the flooded roadways.  The flash flooding event very quickly transitioned into a historic hydrologic event as several rivers, lakes and bayous suffered major flooding conditions with many reaching record crests.  This of course resulted in a daily watch of numerous levees and dams for North Louisiana's waterways with numerous subdivisions built in the vicinity of these waterways.  The Louisiana National Guard was dispatched by the Governor of Louisiana to help respond to the needs of citizens of North Louisiana which included evacuation assistance, rescues by vehicle, boat and helicopter, distribution and supply of water, security and shelter support and distribution of sandbags.  Numerous shelters were opened by the Louisiana Red Cross and by local churches across the northern half of the state as well to shelter residents effected by the flood.  A Federal Disaster Declaration was approved for Bienville, Bossier, Caddo, Caldwell, Claiborne, De Soto, Grant, Jackson, La Salle, Lincoln, Natchitoches, Ouachita, Red River, Sabine, Union, Webster and Winn Parishes.  Some of the more impressive 5-Day rainfall totals were as follows:  Monroe 3.2 SSE:  26.96, Taylortown: 20.39, Rocky Branch 1.3 W: 20.29, Barksdale AFB: 19.09, Minden: 18.73 Ruston 5.5 NW:  18.02, Hodges Gardens: 17.90, Natchitoches: 16.86, Jamestown: 16.85, Caney RAWS: 16.08, Gum Springs RAWS: 15.52, Quitman: 15.50, Stonewall: 15.42, South Southern Hills: 14.88, Columbia 4.1 NNW: 14.77, Coushatta 1.4 E: 14.21, Jena: 11.27, Catahoula RAWS: 8.69.",3

Numerous high water rescues were conducted by first responders which included rescuing occupants trapped in their vehicles as well as the rescuing of residents from flooded homes across the parish.  Flooding was significant for residents along Lake Bistineau as well as Dorcheat Bayou in Webster Parish.  These bodies of water saw significant rises from the excessive heavy rainfall. Lake Bistineau in the southern portion of Webster Parish set a new record stage of 150.16 feet on March 13th which broke the previous record stage of 147.79 feet in April of 1991. This resulted in severe flooding of both stilted and unstilted homes. Numerous boathouses were submerged. Nearly all access roads to the lake were cut off and travel by boat was the only practical method of transportation.  On Dorcheat Bayou at Dixie Inn, the bayou crested at 25.95 feet on March 12th which was a record crest beating the previous record of 25.12 feet in April of 1997.  At this stage, thousands of acres of land occurred.  Low parts of Dixie Inn suffered severe flooding and the restaurant and boat launch adjacent to the gauge in Dixie Inn was flooded.  The Governor's Office of Homeland Security determined that upwards of 400 homes across Webster Parish were completely flooded with 819 homes having registered some sort of flood damage from the 5-day event.

The lake also set an all time record release at the dam of 207,644 cubic feet per second or 1.5 million gallons of water per second.  Nine gates at the dam were open 22 feet to release this kind of water which is the highest the spillway gates have ever been opened.  Some camps and small homes along the lake shore were flooded along with numerous boat houses.  Evacuations became mandatory for residents along the River Road area, Caraway Island and the lower Garrett Park areas.

In addition, 36 high water vehicles and 16 boats were called in to assist in the effort. Numerous roads were inundated with flood waters and closed across Claiborne Parish. Numerous high water rescues were conducted by first responders which included rescuing occupants trapped in their vehicles as well as the rescuing of residents from flooded homes across the parish.  The Governor's Office of Homeland Security determined that upwards of 100 homes across Claiborne Parish were completely flooded with 309 homes having registered some sort of flood damage from the 5-day event. Public property damage estimates were still pending at the time of this writing. Several Red Cross shelters were set up across the parish for flooded residents.

The Louisiana National Guard was deployed by the Governor of Louisiana to assist local law enforcement in the massive response to the prolonged flooding event. These operations included evacuations, search and rescue, distribution and supply of water and meals, security and shelter support and distribution of sandbags and sandbag filling machines. In addition, 36 high water vehicles and 16 boats were called in to assist in the effort. Numerous roads were closed during the height of the storm across Bienville Parish. Numerous high water rescues were conducted by first responders which included rescuing occupants trapped in their vehicles as well as the rescuing of residents from flooded homes across the parish.  Lake Bistineau in the western portion of Bienville Parish set a new record stage of 150.16 feet on March 13th which broke the previous record stage of 147.79 feet in April of 1991. This resulted in severe flooding of both stilted and unstilted homes. Numerous boathouses were submerged. Nearly all access roads to the lake were cut off and travel by boat was the only practical method of transportation. Residents in the Kepler Creek Lake area were stranded by high water as many roadways leading into and away from the lake were inundated with some homes along the lake shore suffering water damage. The Governor's Office of Homeland Security determined that upwards of 85 homes across Bienville Parish were completely flooded with 341 homes having registered some sort of flood damage from the 5-day event. Public property damage estimates were still pending at the time of this writing. Several Red Cross shelters were set up across the parish for flooded residents. As a result, the Governor of Louisiana declared a State of Emergency for Bienville Parish and wrote a Federal Disaster Declaration for the parish as well.","A strong upper level low pressure system settled over northern Mexico on March 8th, and became stationary through March 12th as it was cut off from the upper level jet stream, with a blocking upper ridge having developed over Florida and the western Atlantic.

The following were subdivision and/or apartment complexes that were under mandatory evacuations during the height of the flash flooding:  Louis Locke, Rowan Circle, Deborah Drive/River Oaks, Parkview Apartments, Treasure Island, Oregon Trail, Riverwood Apartments and the Town and Country Subdivision. The Ouachita River saw a significant rise and crest to 45.89 feet in Monroe as a result of the excessive heavy rainfall.  At this level, water is at the level of the under clearance of the Illinois Railroad Bridge.  The Prairion Bayou Recreational Area was flooded and closed and the Bayou D'Arbonne (Rocky Branch), Bawcomville and Moon Lake Recreational areas were all flooded and closed.  In addition, the Lazarre Point Recreational area was flooded and inaccessible with the Forsythe Recreational Area flooded and closed.  The flooding was so significant in the vicinity of Bayou DeSiard near the campus of The University of Louisiana Monroe that the bayou overflowed its banks out onto campus streets were fish were seen swimming in the streets.  The Governor's Office of Homeland Security determined that upwards of 5437 homes across Ouachita Parish were completely flooded with 9500 homes having registered some sort of flood damage from the 5-day event. Public property damage estimates were upwards of 35 million dollars. Upwards of 7 shelters were set up across the parish for flooded residents. As a result, the Governor of Louisiana declared a State of Emergency for Ouachita Parish and wrote a Federal Disaster Declaration for the parish as well.","A strong upper level low pressure system settled over northern Mexico on March 8th, and became stationary through March 12th as it was cut off from the upper level jet stream, with a blocking upper ridge having developed over Florida and the western Atlantic. Meanwhile, a weak frontal boundary entered the region from the west on the 8th, and became stationary over Deep East Texas, Northwest Louisiana, and Southwest Arkansas. Upper level disturbances ejected northeast ahead of the Northern Mexico low pressure system, resulting in periods of showers and thunderstorms containing heavy rainfall to move repeatedly over these areas. The air mass was most unstable on the 8th, where several severe thunderstorms developed and produced wind damage across portions of Northwest and North Central Louisiana, as well as East Texas. However, widespread heavy rainfall was relentless along and ahead of the surface front over Deep East Texas, all of North Louisiana, and Southwest Arkansas where widespread flash flooding occurred. Widespread rainfall amounts of 12-18 inches fell during the 4 day period across Deep East Texas and all of North Louisiana, with amounts in excess of 24 inches across Ouachita Parish. This flooding was of epic proportions across the entire northern half of the state, something the Emergency Management community said they have never experienced before.  Thousands of structures suffered some sort of water damage along with thousands of road surfaces as well.  Many road surfaces, bridges and low water crossings were completely washed out.  This resulted in many high water rescues of stranded motorists, especially during the very beginnings of the prolonged flooding event.  Many motorists drove around barricades and into the flooded roadways.  The flash flooding event very quickly transitioned into a historic hydrologic event as several rivers, lakes and bayous suffered major flooding conditions with many reaching record crests.  This of course resulted in a daily watch of numerous levees and dams for North Louisiana's waterways with numerous subdivisions built in the vicinity of these waterways.  The Louisiana National Guard was dispatched by the Governor of Louisiana to help respond to the needs of citizens of North Louisiana which included evacuation assistance, rescues by vehicle, boat and helicopter, distribution and supply of water, security and shelter support and distribution of sandbags.  Numerous shelters were opened by the Louisiana Red Cross and by local churches across the northern half of the state as well to shelter residents effected by the flood.  A Federal Disaster Declaration was approved for Bienville, Bossier, Caddo, Caldwell, Claiborne, De Soto, Grant, Jackson, La Salle, Lincoln, Natchitoches, Ouachita, Red River, Sabine, Union, Webster and Winn Parishes.

The Louisiana National Guard was deployed by the Governor of Louisiana to assist local law enforcement in the massive response to the prolonged flooding event. These operations included evacuations, search and rescue, distribution and supply of water and meals, security and shelter support and distribution of sandbags and sandbag filling machines. In addition, 36 high water vehicles and 16 boats were called in to assist in the effort. Numerous roads were inundated and closed with flood waters during the height of the event across Caldwell Parish. Numerous high water rescues were conducted by first responders which included rescuing occupants trapped in their vehicles as well as the rescuing of residents from flooded homes across the parish.  The Ouachita River saw a significant rise and crest to 68.4 feet at the Columbia Lock and Dam as a result of the excessive heavy rainfall.  The Governor's Office of Homeland Security determined that upwards of 220 homes across Caldwell Parish were completely flooded with 731 homes having registered some sort of flood damage from the 5-day event.

Some of the more impressive 5 day totals across the parish were as follows: Jena: 11.27 inches. The Louisiana National Guard was deployed by the Governor of Louisiana to assist local law enforcement in the massive response to the prolonged flooding event. These operations included evacuations, search and rescue, distribution and supply of water and meals, security and shelter support and distribution of sandbags and sandbag filling machines. In addition, 36 high water vehicles and 16 boats were called in to assist in the effort. Numerous roads were closed during the height of the storm across La Salle Parish. Numerous high water rescues were conducted by first responders which included rescuing occupants trapped in their vehicles as well as the rescuing of residents from flooded homes across the parish.  The Little River, which borders Grant and La Salle Parishes in Northern Louisiana, saw a record crest at Rochelle, Louisiana with a stage of 50.10 feet on March 13th.  Catahoula Lake in the southern portion of La Salle Parish rose and crested at 52.62 feet on March 20th.  Numerous homes, stilted and unstilted were flooded along the lake shore of this lake along with numerous boat houses completely inundated.  The Governor's Office of Homeland Security determined that upwards of 130 homes across La Salle Parish were completely flooded with 158 homes having registered some sort of flood damage from the 5-day event. Public property damage estimates were still pending at the time of this writing. Several Red Cross shelters were set up across the parish for flooded residents. As a result, the Governor of Louisiana declared a State of Emergency for La Salle Parish and wrote a Federal Disaster Declaration for the parish as well.","A strong upper level low pressure system settled over northern Mexico on March 8th, and became stationary through March 12th as it was cut off from the upper level jet stream, with a blocking upper ridge having developed over Florida and the western Atlantic. Meanwhile, a weak frontal boundary entered the region from the west on the 8th, and became stationary over Deep East Texas, Northwest Louisiana, and Southwest Arkansas. Upper level disturbances ejected northeast ahead of the Northern Mexico low pressure system, resulting in periods of showers and thunderstorms containing heavy rainfall to move repeatedly over these areas. The air mass was most unstable on the 8th, where several severe thunderstorms developed and produced wind damage across portions of Northwest and North Central Louisiana, as well as East Texas. However, widespread heavy rainfall was relentless along and ahead of the surface front over Deep East Texas, all of North Louisiana, and Southwest Arkansas where widespread flash flooding occurred. Widespread rainfall amounts of 12-18 inches fell during the 4 day period across Deep East Texas and all of North Louisiana, with amounts in excess of 24 inches across Ouachita Parish. This flooding was of epic proportions across the entire northern half of the state, something the Emergency Management community said they have never experienced before.  Thousands of structures suffered some sort of water damage along with thousands of road surfaces as well.  Many road surfaces, bridges and low water crossings were completely washed out.  This resulted in many high water rescues of stranded motorists, especially during the very beginnings of the prolonged flooding event.  Many motorists drove around barricades and into the flooded roadways.  The flash flooding event very quickly transitioned into a historic hydrologic event as several rivers, lakes and bayous suffered major flooding conditions with many reaching record crests.  This of course resulted in a daily watch of numerous levees and dams for North Louisiana's waterways with numerous subdivisions built in the vicinity of these waterways.  The Louisiana National Guard was dispatched by the Governor of Louisiana to help respond to the needs of citizens of North Louisiana which included evacuation assistance, rescues by vehicle, boat and helicopter, distribution and supply of water, security and shelter support and distribution of sandbags.  Numerous shelters were opened by the Louisiana Red Cross and by local churches across the northern half of the state as well to shelter residents effected by the flood.

There were 2 other injuries reported with this accident.","A strong upper level low pressure system settled over northern Mexico on March 8th, and became stationary through March 12th as it was cut off from the upper level jet stream, with a blocking upper ridge having developed over Florida and the western Atlantic. Meanwhile, a weak frontal boundary entered the region from the west on the 8th, and became stationary over Deep East Texas, Northwest Louisiana, and Southwest Arkansas. Upper level disturbances ejected northeast ahead of the Northern Mexico low pressure system, resulting in periods of showers and thunderstorms containing heavy rainfall to move repeatedly over these areas. The air mass was most unstable on the 8th, where several severe thunderstorms developed and produced wind damage across portions of Northwest and North Central Louisiana, as well as East Texas. However, widespread heavy rainfall was relentless along and ahead of the surface front over Deep East Texas, all of North Louisiana, and Southwest Arkansas where widespread flash flooding occurred. Widespread rainfall amounts of 12-18 inches fell during the 4 day period across Deep East Texas and all of North Louisiana, with amounts in excess of 24 inches across Ouachita Parish. This flooding was of epic proportions across the entire northern half of the state, something the Emergency Management community said they have never experienced before.  Thousands of structures suffered some sort of water damage along with thousands of road surfaces as well.  Many road surfaces, bridges and low water crossings were completely washed out.  This resulted in many high water rescues of stranded motorists, especially during the very beginnings of the prolonged flooding event.  Many motorists drove around barricades and into the flooded roadways.  The flash flooding event very quickly transitioned into a historic hydrologic event as several rivers, lakes and bayous suffered major flooding conditions with many reaching record crests.  This of course resulted in a daily watch of numerous levees and dams for North Louisiana's waterways with numerous subdivisions built in the vicinity of these waterways.  The Louisiana National Guard was dispatched by the Governor of Louisiana to help respond to the needs of citizens of North Louisiana which included evacuation assistance, rescues by vehicle, boat and helicopter, distribution and supply of water, security and shelter support and distribution of sandbags.  Numerous shelters were opened by the Louisiana Red Cross and by local churches across the northern half of the state as well to shelter residents effected by the flood.

Marginally severe hail, periodic wind damage, and several funnel cloud reports were received, with some of these storms producing very heavy rainfall in a short period of time which resulted in flash flooding over portions of Northcentral Louisiana, as grounds were still saturated from prior heavy rainfall and extensive flooding that had occurred earlier in the month.",165

This cold front was out ahead of a positively tilted upper trough, as it progressed southeast into Oklahoma during the afternoon. Meanwhile, a shortwave trough ejecting northeast over Southeast Texas and Central Louisiana ahead of the main upper trough during the morning contributed to scattered to numerous shower and thunderstorm development over Southeast Texas and Southwest Louisiana prior to daybreak on the 3rd, which advanced northeast into Deep East Texas and Central/Southern Louisiana shortly there-afterwards. Additional showers and thunderstorms quickly developed over Southeast Oklahoma and Southwest Arkansas along and just ahead of the front and associated upper trough around/shortly after daybreak. Given the adequate shear and steep lapse rates aloft ahead of the main upper trough, some of the storms over Southeast Oklahoma became severe, producing large hail during the morning. Isolated severe thunderstorms also developed farther south across East Texas and Western Louisiana, with large hail initially the main threat. However, as the air mass destabilized with additional diurnal heating ahead of the front, more numerous strong to severe thunderstorms developed by afternoon as large scale forcing increased ahead of the approaching upper trough, interacting with the warm front over East Texas/Western Louisiana, as well as a mesoscale boundary left behind over portions of the Sam Rayburn Country across Central Louisiana from the morning storms.

In addition to the widespread flooding, reports of downed trees and power lines were received over portions of Deep East Texas and Northcentral Louisiana, as some of the stronger squalls produced wind gusts to 35-40 mph with locally higher gusts atop already saturated grounds.||Here are the 4 day cumulative rainfall totals across portions of Northcentral Louisiana: In Bienville Parish, Arcadia 4.09 inches.

After Harvey made landfall in far Southwest Louisiana during the early morning hours of August 30th, the more concentrated bands of heavy rain were concentrated on the northwest side of the center, which slowly drifted northeast into Central Louisiana during the afternoon and evening hours. Thus, more significant reports of flash flooding were received across Deep East Texas and Westcentral Louisiana, before drier air had begun to wrap around the center, thus reducing rainfall rates as the center moved into Northeast Louisiana during the early morning hours of August 31st. In addition to the widespread flooding, reports of downed trees and power lines were received over portions of Deep East Texas and Northcentral Louisiana, as some of the stronger squalls produced wind gusts to 35-40 mph with locally higher gusts atop already saturated grounds.||Here are the 4 day cumulative rainfall totals across portions of Northcentral Louisiana: In Bienville Parish, Arcadia 4.09 inches.
