Repository for ENV 872 final project for Griffin Bird and Haley Clapper

This analysis was conducted by Griffin Bird and Haley Clapper, masters studetns at Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment. 

The flood data in this folder came from NOAA's Storm Events Database (https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/). The query to retrieve the data was: State = Louisiana, Begin Date = 01/01/1990, End Date = 12/31/2022, Event Type(s) = Flood, Flash Flood. Flood duration was calcualted in R using difftime between the start date-time and end date-time included in the datasets.
